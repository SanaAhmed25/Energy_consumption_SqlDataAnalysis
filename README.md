## Instructions to Run Queries

1. Download the provided CSV file and load it into your system (e.g., MySQL, SSMS, etc.).  
2. Before running the queries, **check for any NULL values** in the dataset and handle them as needed.  
3. For convenience, I have also uploaded cleaned CSV files without NULL values â€” you can use those directly.  
4. Ensure that the **table name** in your database matches the one used in the queries.  
5. Once the data is loaded and ready, you can run the queries from this repository.
